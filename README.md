# dotfiles
My Arch i3 Dotfiles (again)
# Monochrome Rice

# MAKE SURE TO GIT CLONE THIS INSIDE ~/.config


# Important Note:
When installing this, make sure to reconfigure the xrandr, as it's currently set up for my double monitor setup.

#
# Installation:
`cd ~/.config`<br>
`git clone https://github.com/d-obfuscation/dotfiles`<br>
`cd dotfiles`<br>
`chmod +x install.sh`<br>
`./install.sh`<br>
Then press $mod1 + shift + R to refresh i3<br>

it should be complete after that.
if not, open an issue or find a way to contact me..
