# Important Note:
When installing this, make sure to reconfigure the xrandr, as it's currently set up for my double monitor setup.

#
# Installation:
`cd ~/.config`
`git clone https://github.com/d-obfuscation/dotfiles`
`cd dotfiles`
`python3 install.py`
**Restart your terminal**
`python3 install2.py`

it should be complete.. i didnt care too much about writing the installer, so its probs broken (lol)

if it is.. just open an issue or something.
